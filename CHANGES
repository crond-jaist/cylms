CyLMS v1.1
----------
* Added support for cyber range access via VNC by displaying a button
  labeled "ACCESS CYBER RANGE" on the SCORM package training pages,
  and setting up a corresponding VNC service on the LMS server
* Improved the manner in which activities are displayed by adding the
  training title and time when it was added to Moodle
* Added support for specifying a directory where resources, such as
  images, included in the training content are located; the files in
  this directory are automatically copied into the SCORM package
* Made the training title an optional field; the training id is used
  instead of it if the title is not defined
* Added support for specifying multiple correct answers in the YAML
  file by using the CSV format
* Improved the quiz result page of the SCORM package template
* Added a demo quiz to illustrate more thoroughly the CyLMS content
  representation format
* Improved handling of choices for multiple-choice questions: list
  format is now also supported
* Added support for enabling/disabling the display of the "Access
  Range" button on SCORM package training pages
* Improved handling of ZIP archives by using the internal Python
  library "shutil"
* Added script "configure.py" to automate the set up procedure by
  using a wizard-like command-line interface
* Minor bug fixes and improvements

CyLMS v1.0
----------
* Renamed the tool set from cnt2lms to CyLMS; the main program called
  cylms.py is now the entry point for accessing all the functionality
  provided by CyLMS
* Reorganized the source code in order to better reflect the extended
  LMS integration functionality that was included in this release (see
  below for details)
* Changed the role of the configuration file to be used only for
  static settings, and introduced new keywords; please check
  'config_example' before running CyLMS for the first time
* Improved the integration with the Moodle LMS by adding support for
  dynamic activity creation and removal; the Moosh shell for Moodle is
  used for this purpose (https://moosh-online.com/)
* Made "question" field not mandatory in the training file, so as to
  allow more flexibility in content generation (e.g., enable use for
  instructions, default content, etc.)
* Added support for handling remote Moodle hosts, so that CyLMS
  doesn't necessarily have to be installed directly on those hosts
* Minor bug fixes and improvements

cnt2lms v0.3
------------
* Improved robustness when dealing with incorrect/missing input files
* Renamed two training fields to better convey their meaning, as well
  as use in the generated SCORM package: "description" => "title";
  "header" => "overview"
* Made "level" field in training optional (hence it can now be omitted
  if not needed)
* Renamed a question field to reduce confusion with similar named
  ones: "content" => "body"
* Made "type" field of question optional (as question type can now be
  auto-detected), and modified one of the accepted values: "fill" =>
  "fill-in"
* Renamed field indicating available options for multiple-choice
  questions: "choice" => "choices", and simplified the input format,
  so that double quote symbols are not required anymore
* Simplified syntax for "hints" array of questions, by eliminating the
  prefix "hint:", and fixed an issue related to the case when the tag
  "hints" does not appear
* Eliminated unnecessary buttons "Previous" and "Next" from SCORM
  template
* Minor bug fixes and improvements
